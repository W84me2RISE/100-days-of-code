# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 12, 2018

Mentally prepared for the start of the challenge for the most part today. Also, I gathered notes on how I would attack the challenge since I won't be taking on the freecodingcamp.com's cirriculum. I'll be doing various courses from EdX and codecademy.com. Simce it's nearly midnight, I'm about to sleep. Excited to start this challenge tomorrow!


### Day 1: December 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp for HTML5 code, codecademy's c++ coding course, and I've.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding again, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve a challenge after a lot fo time away from my computer.

**Links to work**: 
None
